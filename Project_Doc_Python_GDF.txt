Python Project:
As you can see, i'm pretty late.
I commented before updloading this that it was quiet hard for me to spend time with my job for Python which is for me 
much more difficult to understand that SQL.
I come from scratchs and it was tough.
The stackoverflow site helped me a lot also udacity material.



The more difficult for me was to implement the while loop rule with a validation.
For the while loop at the begining the Udacity material was helpfull even if i failled a lot.
but i got a lot of difficulties with the def(main) loop validation ending.
Luckely, i found that which helped me after tons of tries.
